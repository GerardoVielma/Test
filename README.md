# Description 
This project contains a verilog design file and the respective constraint file. The goal for this project is to create a "game" where the user
has to correctly guess the 4 pseudo random numbers that slide across the 7-segment displays. The user has 4 attempts per number to guess the first digit,
then second and so on. The code also implements a score system that changes whether the user was able to correctly guess all 4 digits or not.
After a guess, the board will flash LED[0] if the guess was lower than the number generated or LED[15] if the guess was higher. If the guess 
is correct all LED's will begin flashing.
